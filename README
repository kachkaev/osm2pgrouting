FORK DETAILS
=========================

This fork contans changes that allow building osm2pgrouting on Mac OS X (tested on 10.8).

The steps are the following:

0. Make sure you have macports installed (‘port’ command should work in the terminal)
1. Install ‘boost’ using macports
    sudo port install boost
2. Clone the repo to any directory
    cd /path
    git clone git@github.com:kachkaev/osm2pgrouting.git
    cd ./osm2pgrouting
3. Run ‘make’ command
    make

That’s it! Now you’ve got a runnable file called osm2pgrouting inside your osm2pgrouting directory.

Alternatively, you can download a precompiled runnable file to avoid all these steps, but there is less guarantee that it will work. You can find it in the ‘dist’ directory of the repo.

ORIGINAL README
=========================

Before you can use this tool for importing Openstreetmap data,
you need to install

1. postgresl
2. postgis
3. pgrouting
4. boost
5. expat

and to prepare a database.

See in the documentation of the pgrouting website for more informations:
http://pgrouting.postlbs.org/

For compiling this tool, you will need boost, libpq and expat:
Then just type: make


Start the program like this:

./osm2pgrouting -file your-OSM-XML-File.osm -conf mapconfig.xml -dbname routing -user postgres -clean

all available parameters are:

required: 
-file <file>  		-- name of your osm xml file
-dbname <dbname> 	-- name of your database
-user <user> 		-- name of the user, which have write access to the database
-conf <file> 		-- name of your configuration xml file

optional:
-host <host>  		-- host of your postgresql database (default: 127.0.0.1)
-port <port> 		-- port of your database (default: 5432)
-passwd <passwd> 	-- password for database access
-clean 				-- drop previously created tables
-skipnodes			-- do not load nodes into the node table (reduces runtime)
